First Fork and clone this repo to your terminal!

Spend 5 minutes and answer the following questions.
Quiz your neighbor on them!

- What is a headless browser?
Headless browsers provide automated control of a web page in an environment similar to popular web browsers, but are executed via a command line interface or using network communication. They are particularly useful for testing web pages as they are able to render and understand HTML the same way a browser would, including styling elements such as page layout, colour, font selection and execution of JavaScript and AJAX which are usually not available when using other testing methods

is a web browser without a graphical user interface. In other words it is a browser, a piece of software, that access web pages but doesn't show them to any human being. They're actually used to provide the content of web pages to other programs

- What is Selenium?
 automates browsers.
 Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.

 is a portable software testing framework for web applications. Selenium provides a record/playback tool for authoring tests without learning a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including Java, C#, Groovy, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. The tests can then be run against most modern web browsers. 

- What is yml?
another markup language.  looks like python.  white space sensitive, must be indented.

- What is end to end testing?
is a technique used to test whether the flow of an application right from start to finish is behaving as expected. The purpose of performing end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the data integrity is maintained between various system components and systems.

- What is continuous integration?
everyone pushes up the code and then you continually take the code and merge it in.  Then write your tests. if the test fails you did somehting wrong in your code.

- What should be expect to happen if the lotion isn't in the basket?
